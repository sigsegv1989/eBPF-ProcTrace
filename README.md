# eBPF-ProcTrace

Welcome to the eBPF-ProcTrace repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive process tracing solution using eBPF technology. Monitor process starts system-wide, including within containers, to gain valuable insights into process behavior and resource utilization.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Process Tracing**: Capture detailed information about process start events, including parent processes, command-line arguments, and timestamps.

- **Container-Aware Monitoring**: Trace processes within containerized environments, allowing you to understand interactions and orchestration.

- **Low Overhead**: Leverage eBPF's efficiency to minimize the impact on system performance, making it suitable for various environments.

- **Customizable Analysis**: Extend and customize the tracing logic to meet your specific monitoring and analysis requirements.
